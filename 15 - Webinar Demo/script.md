# Creating a Timer Using Javascript

Good day, OneCoders! I’m Kim, your speaker for today’s webinar on Coding Class for Beginners: Creating a Timer Using Javascript. Aside from Javascript, we are also going to use HTML and CSS to build our timer. As we dive into this exciting topic, feel free to raise your hand, send some reactions, ask questions via chat, and you can also use your mic if there is something you want to bring up.

Without further ado, let's start. So let me share my screen with you. If you can see my screen, kindly react with a thumbs up. Otherwise, please notify me through voice or chat if there are problems whether I'm showing a blank screen, the fonts are not readable, or any other cases. Thank you for the reactions.

## Use of CodePen

For this session, we are going to use CodePen via this link. So what is the CodePen website?

CodePen allows you to write code directly in the browser. As you write, you can instantly see the results. It’s like having a virtual factory of the object you desire to make.

For us to better understand what we meant by this, let us click on Start Coding.

## Inside CodePen

Okay, we are here. This is CodePen. This is our virtual factory. Inside this view, we have HTML, CSS, JS, and a white screen.

Before discussing all these segments of CodePen, I want you to look around and find the nearest object... or your favorite belonging inside your room. Please send your answers in the chatbox.

Impromptu on the CSS Connections:

1. HTML - Parts, Ingredients, Elements of the Object
2. CSS - Size, Shape, Color, Orientation of the Elements
3. JS - Functionalities, Logic, Features of the Object
