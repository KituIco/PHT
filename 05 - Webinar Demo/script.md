# Creating Dice Using CSS Flexbox

Good day, everyone! I’m Kim, your speaker for today’s webinar on HTML and CSS particularly on CSS Flexbox. As we dive into this exciting topic, feel free to raise your hand, send some reactions, ask questions via chat, and you can also use your mic if there is something you want to bring up. 

Without further ado, let's start.



## Use of CodePen

For this session, we are going to be using CodePen via this link. So what is this codepen website?

CodePen allows you to write code directly in the browser. As you write, you can instantly see the results. It’s like having a virtual factory of the object you desire to make.

For us to better understand what I meant by this, let us click on Start Coding.



## Inside CodePen

Okay, we are here. This is CodePen. This is our virtual factory. Don't get overwhelmed, it may look like there's a lot of stuffs in here. HTML, CSS, JS, and a white screen. 

Before discussing all these segments of CodePen, I want you to look around and find the nearest object... or your favorite belonging inside your room. Please send your answers in the chatbox.

*Impromptu on the CSS Connections*

<ol>
<li>HTML - Parts, Ingredients, Elements of the Object</li>
<li>CSS - Size, Shape, Color, Orientation of the Elements</li>
<li>JS - Functionalities, Logic, Features of the Object</li>
</ol>

We won't be using Javascript.

## Creating a Dice

For this webinar, the object that we would create in CodePen is Dice. It is a good example to practice CSS flexbox. So let me share some HTML and CSS codes with you.
