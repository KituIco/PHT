### Assumptions about the teaching profession

1. <b>Teaching is easy</b>. But it requires great deal of knowledge, skill, and effort (preparation). It must be engaging and effective.
2. I am <b>good at something</b> therefore I will be an effective teacher. Effective teachers are able to create a positive environment and to facilitate acquisition of knowledge and skills.
3. Teaching is <b>not a real profession</b>. People view it as a lower status profession but teaching is a highly important and respected profession that plays a vital role in society.

### Activity
Goal: Creating a Timer Using Asynchronous JS
Instructions: 
1. Prompt the user to enter a time between 1 to 60.
2. Using DOM Manipulation, create a timer displaying the value input as the time in minutes, and '00' as the time in seconds.
3. Create two buttons: the start button and the reset button.
  a. The start button starts the timer. Using asynchronous JS, create a loop where the value of the time in seconds decrements by 1 every second. If the time in seconds is at 0 and there is still time remaining in minutes, decrement the time in minutes by 1, and set the time in seconds to 59. Repeat until the timer reads 00:00, after which the user will be alerted that the time is up.
  b. The reset button sets the time in minutes and the time in seconds to 0.
